## Overview ##

[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-value-prop-what-is/) is a set of services provided by Microsoft Azure to enable developers to easily build and deploy Web apps and mobile apps for various platforms and devices. Included in the App Service family are [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-overview/), which allow you to quickly and easily deploy Web sites built with tools and languages you’re already familiar with; [Azure Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-value-prop/), which provide data services, syncing services, notification services, and other back-end services for popular mobile operating systems; [Azure API Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/), which simplify the writing, publishing, and consuming of cloud APIs; and [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps/), which are great for automating business processes.

Azure Web Apps makes deploying Web sites extraordinarily easy – and not just Web sites built using the Microsoft stack. You can deploy PHP apps that use MySQL just as easily as ASP.NET apps that use SQL Server. You can select from a wide variety of Web App templates or build templates of your own. You can configure Web Apps to auto-scale as traffic increases to ensure that your customers aren’t left waiting during periods of peak demand. You can publish apps to staging locations and test them in the cloud before taking them live, and then swap staging deployments for production deployments with the click of a button. You can even create WebJobs – programs or scripts that run continuously or on a schedule to handle billing and other time-critical tasks. In short, Azure Web Apps takes the pain out of publishing and maintaining Web apps and are just as suitable for a personal photo-sharing site as they are for enterprise-grade sites serving millions of customers.

In this lab, you will use the cross-platform [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  editor to build a Web site that uses [PHP](http://php.net/) server-side scripting. The site will allow you to upload, browse, and display photos, and it will store photos in a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database. You will then provision a new Azure Web App to host the site. Finally, you will upload the site's content to the newly provisioned Web App and view it in your browser.

## Exercise 1: Build a Web site with Visual Studio Code

In this exercise, you will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to build a Web site. Visual Studio Code is a free, cross-platform code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux that supports a variety of programming languages, both natively and via extensions. It features built-in Git support as well as syntax highlighting and code completion via [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/#meet-intellisense).

1. Create a project directory named "WebAppIntro" in the location of your choice — for example, "C:\DXLabs\WebAppIntro."

1. Start Visual Studio Code. Open the **File** menu and select **Open Folder**.

1. Use the **File -> Save** command to save the file. Name it **index.php**.

    ![Saving the file](Images/build-codesavefile.png)

    _Saving the file_
    
1. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to add a file named **image_display.php** containing the following code to the project. This is the code that returns images requested by the browser over HTTP.

	> When pasting code such as this into a PHP file, be *certain* that the closing tag ("?>") on the last line has no extraneous spaces after it. Otherwise, the file will not execute.

    ```php
    <?php
        if ((isset($_GET['id']) && is_numeric($_GET['id'])) === FALSE) die;
    
        include "images.php";
        $imageId = $_GET['id'];
        $image = Images::GetImage($imageId);
    
        // get the source image attributes
        $srcImage = $image->image;
        $srcSize = getImageSizeFromString($srcImage);
        $srcWidth = $srcSize[0];
        $srcHeight = $srcSize[1];
        $srcType = $srcSize[2];
        $srcMime = $srcSize['mime'];
        $srcImageResource = imageCreateFromString($srcImage);
    
        // set the header for the image
        header("Content-type: ".$srcMime);
    
        if ((isset($_GET['width']) && is_numeric($_GET['width'])) === FALSE) {
            // no width requested - just return the source
            echo $srcImage;
            exit;
        }
    
        // resize/resample the image to the requested size
        $destWidth = $_GET['width'];
        $destHeight = $destWidth * $srcSize[1] / $srcSize[0];
    
        $destImageResource = imageCreateTrueColor($destWidth, $destHeight);
        imagealphablending($destImageResource, false);
        imagesavealpha($destImageResource, true);
        imageCopyResampled($destImageResource, $srcImageResource, 0,0,0,0, $destWidth, $destHeight, $srcWidth, $srcHeight);
    
        // export the image
        switch ($srcType) {
            case IMAGETYPE_JPEG:
                imageJPEG($destImageResource);
                break;
            case IMAGETYPE_PNG:
                imagePNG($destImageResource);
                break;
            default:
                imageJPEG($destImageResource);
                break;
        }
    
        imageDestroy($destImageResource);
    ?>
    ```

1. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to add a file named **images.php** containing the following code to the project. This is the code used to upload, store, and retrieve images.

    ```php
	<?php
	    include "database.php";
	
	    class Images {
	
	        public static function Upload() {
	
	            $maxsize = 4194304; // set to 4 MB
	
	            // check associated error code
	            if ($_FILES['imageToUpload']['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
	
	                // check whether file is uploaded with HTTP POST
	                if (is_uploaded_file($_FILES['imageToUpload']['tmp_name'])) {    
	
	                    // check size of uploaded image on server side
	                    if ( $_FILES['imageToUpload']['size'] < $maxsize) {  
	
	                        // check whether uploaded file is of image type
	                        $finfo = finfo_open(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE);
	                        if (strpos(finfo_file($finfo, $_FILES['imageToUpload']['tmp_name']), "image") === 0) {    
	
	                            // open the image file for insertion
	                            $imagefp = fopen($_FILES['imageToUpload']['tmp_name'], 'rb');
	
	                            // put the image in the db...
	                            $database = new Database();
	                            $id = $database->UploadImage($_FILES['imageToUpload']['name'], $imagefp);
	                            header("Location: /");
	                            exit;
	                        }
	                        else { // not an image
	                            echo '<script type="text/javascript">';
	                            echo 'alert("Uploaded file is not an image");';
	                            echo 'window.location.href = "/";';
	                            echo '</script>';
	                            exit;
	                        }
	                    }
	                    else { // file too large
	                        echo '<script type="text/javascript">';
	                        echo 'alert("Uploaded file is too large");';
	                        echo 'window.location.href = "/";';
	                        echo '</script>';
	                        exit;
	                    }
	                }
	                else { // upload failed
	                    echo '<script type="text/javascript">';
	                    echo 'alert("File upload failed");';
	                    echo 'window.location.href = "/";';
	                    echo '</script>';
	                    exit;
	                }
	            }
	            else {
	                echo '<script type="text/javascript">';
	                echo 'alert("File upload failed");';
	                echo 'window.location.href = "/";';
	                echo '</script>';
	                exit;
	            }
	        }
	
	        public static function GetImages() {
	            $database = new Database();
	            $images = $database->GetAllImages();
	            return $images;
	        }
	
	        public static function GetImage($id) {
	            $database = new Database();
	            $image = $database->FindImage($id);
	            return $image;
	        }
	    }
	?>
    ```

1. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to add a file named **database.php** containing the following code to the project. This is the code used to interact with the MySQL database. Observe that the database connection string isn't embedded in the code, but is instead retrieved from an environment variable named ```MYSQLCONNSTR_localdb```. The purpose of this environment variable — and the manner in which it is initialized — is explained at the end of the next exercise.

    ```php
    <?php
        class Database {
    
            private $link;
    
            public function __construct() {
                // Notice that private connection information is *NOT* part of the source
                // and therefore does not end up in public repos, etc.
                $connectionString = getenv("MYSQLCONNSTR_localdb");
                $varsString = str_replace(";","&", $connectionString);
                parse_str($varsString);
    
                $host = $Data_Source;
                $user = $User_Id;
                $pass = $Password;
                $db = $Database;
                
                try{
                    $this->link = new PDO("mysql:host=".$host.";dbname=".$db, $user, $pass);
                    $this->link->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
                
                }
                catch (PDOException $e){
                    echo "Error: Unable to connect to MySQL: ". $e->getMessage();
                    die;
                }
    
                $this->InitializeImageTable();
            }   
    
            public function __destruct() {
                $this->link = null;
            }
    
            public function UploadImage($imageName, $imageFP) {
                $sql = $this->link->prepare("INSERT INTO images (name, image) VALUES (:name, :image);");
                $sql->bindParam(":name", $imageName);
                $sql->bindParam(":image", $imageFP, PDO::PARAM_LOB);
    
                $sql->execute();
            
                return $this->link->lastInsertId();
            }
    
            public function GetAllImages() {
                $sql = $this->link->prepare("SELECT * FROM images;");
                $sql->execute();
                
                $results = $sql->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
                
                return $results;
            }
    
            public function FindImage($id) {
                $sql = $this->link->prepare("SELECT * FROM images WHERE id = :id;");
                $sql->bindParam(":id", $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
                $sql->execute();
                
                $result = $sql->fetch(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
                return $result;
            }
    
            private function InitializeImageTable() {

                $results = $this->link->query("SHOW TABLES LIKE 'images';");
                if ($results == TRUE && $results->rowCount() > 0) {
                    return;
                }

    _Adding a Content folder to the project_
     
1. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to add a file named **styles.css** containing the following CSS to the **Content** folder that you just created:

    ```css
    /* Custom background color for the nav-bar element. */
    .navbar {
        background-color: #d9edf7;    /*matches bg-info*/
        background-image: none;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        filter: none;
    }
    
    /* Support for custom-looking File Selection button. */
    .btn-file {
        position: relative;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
    .btn-file input[type=file] {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        right: 0;
        min-width: 100%;
        min-height: 100%;
        font-size: 100px;
        text-align: right;
        filter: alpha(opacity=0);
        opacity: 0;
        outline: none;
        background: white;
        cursor: inherit;
        display: block;
    }
    
    /* Styling/framing for the image elements. */
    img {
        width: 192px;
        background-color: white;
        padding: 5px 5px 30px 5px;
		cursor: pointer;
    }
    
    /* Custom queries for force line breaks depending on the resolution. */
    @media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .col-lg-2:nth-child(6n+1) {
            clear: both;
        }
    }
    
    @media (min-width: 992pxpx) and (max-width: 1200px) {
        .col-md-4:nth-child(3n+1) {
            clear: both;
        }
    }
    
    @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 992px) {
        .col-sm-6:nth-child(2n+1) {
            clear: both;
        }
    }
    ```

The files listed in the Explorer panel for your project should now look like this:

That's it! Your photo-sharing Web site is built. The next step is to provision an Azure Web App to host it.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Provision a MySQL Web App

There are several ways to provision an Azure Web App. In this exercise, you will use the Azure Portal to do it. Provisioning is quick and easy and involves little more than answering a few questions and clicking a few buttons. Once the Web App is provisioned, you can view it in your browser just as you would any other Web site.

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser. If you are asked to log in, do so using your Microsoft account.

1. Click **+ New**. In the "New" blade that opens, type "web app mysql" (without quotation marks) into the search box and press **Enter**.

    ![Finding the "Web App + MySQL" template](Images/find-webappmysql.png)

    _Finding the "Web App + MySQL" template_

1. Two new blades named "Marketplace" and "Everything" open in the portal. The former represents the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/), which is an online store containing thousands of free templates for deploying apps, services, virtual machines, and more, preconfigured for Azure and provisioned with popular tools such as WordPress, CakePHP, and Django. In the "Everything" blade, click **Web App + MySQL**.

    ![Selecting the "Web App + MySQL" template](Images/select-webappmysql.png)

    _Selecting the "Web App + MySQL" template_
    
1. In the "Web App + MySQL" blade that opens, take a moment to review the text and learn what the template provisions. Then click the **Create** button at the bottom of the blade.

    ![Creating a Web App with MySQL](Images/create-web-app.png)

    _Creating a Web App with MySQL_

1. Enter a name for your Web app in the **App name** field. *This name must be unique within Azure, so make sure a green check mark appears next to it*. Select **Create new** under **Resource Group** and enter the resource-group name "WebAppsLabResourceGroup" (without quotation marks). Then select **MySQL In App** as the **Database Provider**.

	> Resource groups are a powerful construct for grouping resources such as storage accounts, databases, and virtual machines together so they can be managed as a unit. Deleting a resource group deletes everything inside it and prevents you from having to delete those resources one by one.

    ![Configuring the Web App](Images/web-app-parameters-1.png)

    _Configuring the Web App_

1. Click **App Service plan/location**, and then click **Create New** to create a new App Service plan for your Web app. In the "New App Service plan" blade, enter "WebAppsLabServicePlan" (without quotation marks) as the service-plan name and select the location nearest you. Then click **Pricing tier** and select the **F1 Free** tier. Click **Select** to finalize your tier selection, and then click **OK** in the "New App Service plan" blade to create the new service plan.

    ![Creating an App Service plan](Images/web-app-parameters-2.png)

    _Creating an App Service plan_

1. Check **Pin to Dashboard** at the bottom of the "Web App + MySQL" blade, and then click the **Create** button to create your Web app.

    ![Creating the Web App](Images/web-app-parameters-4.png)

    _Creating the Web App_
    
1. Once the Web App has been created (it usually takes about one minute), click the tile that was created for it on the dashboard if the blade for the Web App doesn't open automatically.

1. Click the Web site URL to browse to the placeholder page for your new Web site. 

    ![The Web site URL](Images/open-websiteplaceholder.png)

    _The Web site URL_

1. Confirm that the placeholder page appears. Then close the browser window or tab in which it opened and return to the Azure Portal.

    ![The Web site's temporary home page](Images/placeholder-page.png)

    _The Web site's temporary home page_

When the app was provisioned, an in-app SQL database was provisioned for it, too. The PHP code that you added in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1) retrieves a connection string for the database by calling ```getenv("MYSQLCONNSTR_localdb");```. The environment variable ```MYSQLCONNSTR_localdb``` is created as part of the provisioning process and is created specifically for the purpose of connecting to in-app SQL databases.
    
<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Deploy the Web site

Now it is time to copy the files that comprise your Web site to the Azure Web App. In this exercise, you will publish your Web site using FTP.

1. Click **Deployment credentials** in the blade for the Web App.
 
    ![Viewing deployment credentials](Images/deploy-deploymentcredentials.png)

    _Viewing deployment credentials_

1. Enter a user name and password for connecting to your site via FTP. **Be sure to remember the password**. Click the **Save** button at the top of the blade to save these credentials.

    ![Specifying FTP credentials](Images/deploy-enter-credentials.png)

    _Specifying FTP credentials_

1. Click **Overview** in the blade for the Web app.

    ![Specifying FTP credentials](Images/open-overview.png)

    _Specifying FTP credentials_

1. Locate the **FTP/deployment username** and **FTP hostname** values. Hover the mouse cursor over the FTP hostname and click the **Copy** button that appears on the right to copy the hostname to the clipboard.
  
    ![The FTP username and hostname](Images/deploy-getftpstrings.png)

    _The FTP username and hostname_

1. Open a File Explorer window and paste the FTP hostname value into the address box at the top of the window. Then press **Enter**.
     
    ![Entering the FTP hostname in File Explorer](Images/deploy-windowsenterftphostname.png)

    _Entering the FTP hostname in File Explorer_
     
1. When prompted to enter FTP credentials, enter the FTP username (the **FTP/deployment username** in Step 4) and the password you specified in Step 2. Then click **Log On**.

    ![Entering your FTP credentials](Images/deploy-windowscredentials.png)
    
    _Entering your FTP credentials_

1. Double-click the **site** folder in the File Explorer window.

    ![Opening the site folder](Images/deploy-open-site-folder.png)
    
    _Opening the site folder_

1. Double-click the **wwwroot** folder in the File Explorer window. This is the root folder for your Web site.

    ![Opening the wwwroot folder](Images/deploy-open-wwwroot-folder.png)
    
    _Opening the wwwroot folder_

1. Delete the **hostingstart.html** file. This is the placeholder page you saw earlier when you connected to the site in your browser. When prompted to confirm the deletion, select **Yes**.
    
1. Open another File Explorer window and navigate to the folder containing the Web site files you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).
    
1. Copy all of the files and folders that comprise the Web site to your site's **wwwroot** folder.  
       
    ![Copying the Web site files](Images/deploy-windowsftpcopy.png)

    _Copying the Web site files_

1. Congratulations! You now have a working Web site. Click the site URL in the Azure Portal to open the site in your browser.

    ![Navigating to the finished Web site](Images/deploy-go-to-web-site.png)

    _Navigating to the finished Web site_

1. Upload a few images to the Web site. Click any of the image thumbnails to see an enlarged view.

	> The code that uploads the images limits file uploads to 4 MB to stay under PHP's default upload-size limit and to improve performance, so be sure to select images that are 4 MB or smaller in size.

    ![The working Web site](Images/final-workingwebsite.png)

    _The working Web site_

## Summary

In this hands-on lab, you learned how to:

- Use Visual Studio Code to build a Web site that uses PHP and MySQL
- Provision an Azure Web App
- Upload a Web site to Azure

Azure Web Apps allows you to use the tools and languages you already know to build great Web sites and publish them to the Web. You can focus on what you know and what you want to accomplish rather than spend time maintaining physical infrastructure, installing security updates, and learning new languages. Moreover, Azure Web Apps can easily leverage other features of the Azure ecosystem such as Azure Storage, Azure Search, and Azure Cognitive Services to achieve unprecedented scale and richness. Which, as it happens, is the subject of the next lab.
